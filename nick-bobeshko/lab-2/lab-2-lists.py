# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

# Exercise
# The target of this exercise is to create a string, an integer, and a floating point number. The string should be named mystring and should contain the word "hello". The floating point number should be named myfloat and should contain the number 10.0, and the integer should be named myint and should contain the number 20.

numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)


# write your code here
second_name = names[1]

# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)
